## Objectives and Experimental Design.
To find the target audience for an online cryptography course using Exploratory Data Analysis with R as follows:
1) Understanding our data by;
- Defining the question.
- The metric for success.
- The context.
- Experimental design.
- The appropriateness of the available data.
2) Data cleaning. This includes dealing with missing values, outliers, duplicates and other anomalies.
3) Exploratory data analysis using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Including data visualisation.
